# The Australian Debating Council

The Australian Debating Council (The ADC) was created in April 2019 at the Australian Intervarsity Debating Championships (Easters). Its mandate is to provide for the growing community of debaters in the Australian debating community. The ADC will replace the Australasian Intervarsity Debating Association in hosting the Easters debating tournament, as well as taking a more active role in promoting and aiding debating in Australia.
